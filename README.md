# Background

For this exercise, you will write an Appointment class that tracks information about an appointment such as the start and end times and a name for the appointment. Your Appointment class will also have an overlaps() method that takes another Appointment object as an argument and determines whether the two appointments overlap.

# Instructions

Write a script named a**ppointment.py** containing a class called Appointment with methods as

described below:

‚Äì self

‚Äì name, a string indicating the name of the appointment (for example, ‚ÄúSales brunch‚Äù).

‚Äì start, a tuple consisting of two integers representing the start time of the appointment. The first integer represents an hour in 24-hour time; the second integer represents a number of minutes. For example, the tuple (10, 30) would represent 10:30 am.

‚Äì end, a tuple similar to start representing the end time of the appointment.

The __init__() method should create attributes name, start, and end, and use them to store the information from the parameters.

**overlaps() method**

Define an overlaps() method with two parameters, self and other, where other is another Appointment object.

This method should return True if self and other overlap and False if they do not. Be sure to return a boolean value rather than a string.

Note that two appointments overlap if

‚Äì The start time of one appointment occurs between the start and end times of the other appointment (including if the start times are equal), OR

‚Äì The end time of one appointment occurs between the start and end times of the other appointment (including if the end times are equal)

# Docstrings

‚Äì Write a docstring for your class that documents the purpose of the class as well as the purpose and expected data type of each attribute.

‚Äì For each of the methods you wrote, write a docstring that documents the purpose of the method as well as the purpose and expected data type of each parameter other than self (you never need to document self in a docstring). If your document returns a value, document that. If your document has side effects, such as modifying attributes or writing to standard output, document those as well.

‚Äì Be sure your docstrings are the first statement in the class or method they document. Improperly

positioned docstrings are not recognized as docstrings by Python.
